TITLE:
Buffer handling refactoring, floating-point optimization.

DESCRIPTION:
The buffer class should be inherited from the fundamental-binary-stream class, 
and the usual buffer handling methods, like read-byte and write-byte should be 
implemented for it.

BENEFIT:
It would result a cleaner implementation and probably make floating point 
optimization for possible. It seems to be necessary for these implementations 
because they only support "raw" floating point coding via streams. See
ext:read-float and ext:write-float of CLISP...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TITLE:
Supporting more Lisp implementations.

DESCRIPTION:
The codec should be changed so to be able to compile and use with ECL and
ABCL as well.

BENEFIT:
Maybe more users.
