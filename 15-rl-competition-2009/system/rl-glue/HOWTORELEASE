Update the ChangeLog
-------------------------------------
Changelog can be automatically updated by having SVN2CL installed:
http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/svn2cl/

Before release, the changelog can be updated automatically.

NOTE:
- Replace 703 with the revision of the latest release.  This will get you just the changes since then.
- Open changelog.new.txt.  Check it out, see if you like it. Then, copy it into ChangeLog, and title it with the current release name.  See ChangeLog to see what I mean.

$> svn2cl --group-by-day -i -o changelog.new.txt --reparagraph --separate-daylogs --authors=authors.xml --revision HEAD:703


Test Test Test
-------------------------------------
$> sudo make uninstall 		#Make sure there is no code being used in the test that shouldn't be
$> make distclean
$> ./configure
$> make
$> make distcheck				#If distcheck passes, you're good
$> sudo make install 			#Re-install on your machine

Make a Tag for the release
-------------------------------------
NOTE: PICK A NAME FOR THE RELEASE AND USE THAT INSTEAD OF rl-glue-3.0-alpha

#We could probably automate this somehow
$> svn cp https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/tags/releases/rlglue-3.0-alpha

Upload the release to Google Code
-------------------------------------
Go here: http://code.google.com/p/rl-glue/downloads/entry

- Make sure to set the tags appropriately:
	Featured Type-Archive OpSys-All
	
- Make sure to deprecate old release
